## What is the Cakewalk Sonitus FX Plugin Suite?
 
The Cakewalk Sonitus FX Plugin Suite is a bundle of 10 audio effects plugins that are compatible with any VST or DX host application. The plugins are:
 
- **Compressor:** A dynamic range processor that reduces the volume of loud signals and boosts the volume of quiet signals. It can be used to control the overall loudness of a track, to smooth out the dynamics of a vocal or instrument, or to add punch and warmth to a drum or bass sound.
- **Equalizer:** A frequency-based processor that allows you to adjust the tonal balance of a sound by boosting or cutting specific frequency bands. It can be used to shape the tone of a sound, to correct unwanted frequencies, or to enhance certain characteristics of a sound.
- **Modulator:** A modulation-based processor that applies periodic changes to a sound using various waveforms and parameters. It can be used to create chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo, vibrato, and other effects.
- **Reverb:** A spatial processor that simulates the acoustic environment of a sound by adding reflections and reverberations. It can be used to create a sense of space and depth for a sound, to add ambience and realism to a mix, or to create special effects.
- **Delay:** A time-based processor that creates echoes and repetitions of a sound by delaying it by a certain amount of time. It can be used to create rhythmic patterns, to add width and movement to a sound, or to create special effects.
- **Gate:** A dynamic processor that silences a sound below a certain threshold level. It can be used to remove unwanted noise or bleed from a track, to tighten up the transients of a drum or percussion sound, or to create special effects.
- **Multiband:** A multi-band processor that splits a sound into several frequency bands and allows you to process each band separately. It can be used to apply different effects to different parts of the frequency spectrum, to balance the levels of different frequency bands, or to create special effects.
- **Phase:** A phase-based processor that shifts the phase of a sound by a certain amount of degrees. It can be used to correct phase issues between multiple tracks, to create stereo width and movement for a mono sound, or to create special effects.
- **Surround:** A surround processor that allows you to create surround mixes using up to six channels. It can be used to create immersive audio experiences for film, TV, video games, or VR applications.
- **Wahwah:** A filter-based processor that creates a wah-wah effect by sweeping the cutoff frequency of a band-pass filter. It can be used to emulate the sound of a wah-wah pedal for guitar or bass, to add expression and character to a sound, or to create special effects.
